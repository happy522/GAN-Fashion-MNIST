# GAN Fashion EMNIST Dataset


This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the Fashion EMNIST dataset. The GAN is used to generate synthetic images of various fashion items, including clothing, accessories, and footwear. The model is built using Python and the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Dataset

The Fashion EMNIST dataset used in this project consists of images of fashion items categorized into 26 classes. Each class corresponds to a different fashion item, such as a t-shirt, dress, handbag, etc. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the GAN model.

## Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, which are trained in a competitive manner:

1. **Generator:** The generator network takes random noise as input and generates synthetic fashion images. It learns to generate images that resemble the real fashion items from the training dataset.

2. **Discriminator:** The discriminator network takes both real images from the dataset and synthetic images from the generator as input. It learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

During training, the generator and discriminator are optimized using adversarial loss functions, enabling the generator to improve its ability to generate realistic images and the discriminator to enhance its ability to distinguish between real and synthetic images.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Set up a Python environment and install the required libraries.
3. **Download and Preprocess the Dataset:** Download the Fashion EMNIST dataset and preprocess it into training and testing sets. The dataset should be split into appropriate classes and image formats for training the GAN.

4. **Train the GAN:** Use the provided script to train the GAN on the preprocessed dataset. The training process will generate synthetic fashion images, improving over time.

5. **Generate Synthetic Images:** After training the GAN, you can use the trained generator to generate synthetic images. Provide random noise as input to the generator to produce various fashion items.

## Results and Visualization

The GAN is capable of generating realistic synthetic images of various fashion items after successful training. The repository includes a notebook or script to visualize the generated images and compare them with real images from the dataset.

## Acknowledgments

The GAN implementation and training process are based on various research papers and open-source projects related to generative models in computer vision.
